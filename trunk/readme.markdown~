# with-me

Some old project Raj and I started thinking on. It involved "valid" or "cool" URIs likes

http://with.me/tacos/ (Who wants to eat tacos with me?)
http://with.me/200/kites/, http://with.me/400/parrots/ (store; searching URLs for quantities)
http://bob.is.with.me/ (generically, or universally, log others in)
http://not.with.me/ (assuming logged in, temporally exclude oneself from a social network; more geo)
http://with.me/1630/eat-pizza/ (geo and time data)

It's a crazy idea, but now, URLs can serve both hypertext (HTML documents) and images based on the notion
of "acceptable response." The browser can be tricked.

What kind of data is a house?
