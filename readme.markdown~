So you know those times when girls have to get up at the same time? 
Do you really notice them? It reminds me of a sitcomical situation 
where some boy is hung up on girls. Most people get hung up on anything. 
And then something happens, it happens coincidentally, sometimes not. 
And sometimes someone notices. Until the thought on the matter becomes 
empty, limited, twisted by the length of time it takes to consider the 
thought. It's before, now, left of something in some hemisphere, of 
neuronic activity and the blasphemous synapsis. It's a warzone of warzones 
all reducible to a set of descriptions never before recorded at the time 
of its previous recording. Some record of a recording resounding completely and happenstancely, as any given member of the species records, which is its power. The species that survives has recorded a formula for its survival, yet this is the exact problematic of interplanetary survival. What does it take for something like us to survive? Why should we take on another planet at all? It might surely be a misallocation of resources, for one polity should endure the material conditions of their labor, all the same. We have observed time and time again the cycle of civilizations, and yet what does it mean to start a civilization? What conditions must hold? What technologies must there be in place. We have considered the Mayan Templates as they present themselves scientifically at 10,000 years before any known such form of architecture. And surely, what kind of language must exist such that the Internet may be permitted? Every bit of information, let us say, behaves as a qubit at some perspective, from some scale. What of genes?
